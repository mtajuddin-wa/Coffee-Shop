            <p>This is a coffee shop made by a developer</p></br>
            <p>I checked in for the night at Out O The Way motel. What a bad choice that was. First I took a shower and
                a spider crawled out of the drain. Next, the towel rack fell down when I reached for the one small bath
                towel. This allowed the towel to fall halfway into the toilet. I tried to watch a movie, but the remote
                control was sticky and wouldn't stop scrolling through the channels. I gave up for the night and crawled
                into bed. I stretched out my leg and felt something furry by my foot. Filled with fear, I reached down
                and to my surprise, I pulled out a raccoon skin pair of underwear. After my initial relief that it
                wasn't alive, the image of a fat, ugly businessman wearing raccoon skin briefs filled my brain. I jumped
                out of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards my car.</p>

            <p>Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it inside out and if there was ever
                anyone looking for an expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was
                nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly
                memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic.</p>
